This is the task for Asympto.
Here, I have build the front page based on the given figma link.
https://www.figma.com/file/tlVbMpacnMGWDtoiKC9lvg/az-eval?node-id=1%3A2351&t=tSMqY5PQ7q2fMBF1-0

Here, I have added a modal for the Header section only. Where, if some user will click into the link of shop now / the top search/cart/user icon. Modal will open with respective section details.

## Note:

1. Due to some time boundation(family-event), I could not able add the mobile responsiveness over here.

2. It's a webpack configard react project, where I have configure the Webpack rather than the create-react-app.

Thanks in advance.
